# Springloaded Presets

This is a repository of presets that we commonly use for Springloaded projects.

Check the individual folders of the repository for information on the specific presets.

## Alias

In order to make using presets easier, here's a helpful alias you can add to your system:

```bash
alias slp="preset apply springloadedco/presets --path"
```

Then you can install presets by running:

```bash
slp <preset-name>
```
